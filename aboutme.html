   <h1>About Me</h1>
   <p>My goal for my professional life is sort of unclear at the moment. If by the end of my high school life I still don't know what I want to do career wise,  I will most likely try and become a realtor. I always enjoyed that field and I believe I could make a career out of it. My mother was also a realtor so watching her work when i was younger inspired me to try and be like her. In my personal life though, my only goal ,at the moment is to get a job and start earning some of my own income. I would also like to advice in my athletic area. I am currently helping my mother with some of her properties and helping her manage them. By this I am seeing how the world of realtors actually is. Many has said to be a good realtor, one would have to be really friendly. They would also have to be convincing with that they are trying to sell, like a sells person and would also have to be real rounded with the area they live in. But as for now, I cant do much more then helping my mother with her properties so any short-term goals I have for myself isn't related to my bigger goal in the future. In my High School life, I would like to be able to be on the Varsity Girls Soccer Team and have a good GPA. In life, I would like to be known as a generous person, always there to help anyone in need. I would also like to be known as a kind person and an excellent student.</>
